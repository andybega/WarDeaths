\section{Oddities in the data}

The COW war participants list has two sets of start and end periods for each participant. Mostly the second set is missing, and in those cases where it is not, the second start period is always in the same year or the year after the first end year. So I just used the second end year where applicable.

A given country can also appear more than once in the same war as a participant. Italy during WW2 for example appear twice, once on the Axis side, once on the Allied side. This is preserved in the data.

Material capability variables for a given year are created using the previous year's values. Creating accurate material capability ratios is challenging since participants may enter a war that is already ongoing, and because the set of participants on any given side at any given time may change if previous participants leave.
